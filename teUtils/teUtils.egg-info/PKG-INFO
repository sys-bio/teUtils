Description: Utilities for Tellurium
        =======================
        
        This repo includes a number of useful utilities for Tellurium users. These are included in three modules:
        
        odePrint
        
        This provides a number of methods convert SBML into the equations representing the model. 
           
        plotting
        
        This modules contains a variety of additional plotting methods, include 3D, heatmaps for control coefficients, 
        and ascii plots.
        
        prettyTabular
        
        This modules provides two methods to display fluxes and concentrations in a neat tabular format.
        
        buildNetworks
        
        This modules provides two methods to build a linear chain of reactions using either mass-action or Michaelis-Menten
        kinetics or a random network using uniuni, unibi, biuni or bibi mass-action governed reactions.
