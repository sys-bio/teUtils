    Tellurium Utilities
    ===================

    teUtils provides a number of useful modules.

    This repo includes a number of useful utilities for Tellurium users. These are included in three modules:

    odePrint
    --------

    This provides a number of methods convert SBML into the equations representing the model. 
   
    plotting
    --------

    This modules contains a variety of additional plotting methods, include 3D, heatmaps for control coefficients, and ascii plots.

    prettyTabular
    -------------

    This modules provides two methods to display fluxes and concentrations in a neat tabular format.

    buildNetworks
    -------------

    This module provides a single method that can be used to build linear chaing network with random parmaetr values. The 
    user has a choice of either building a network based on mass-action or Michaelis-Menten kinetics

    scanning
    --------

    At the moment a single metho to do a simple time course parameter scan
