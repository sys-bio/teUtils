Utilities for Tellurium
=======================

This repo includes a number of useful utilities for Tellurium users. These are included in three modules:

odePrint

This provides a number of methods convert SBML into the equations representing the model. 
   
plotting

This modules contains a variety of additional plotting methods, include 3D, heatmaps for control coefficients, 
and ascii plots.

prettyTabular

This modules provides two methods to display fluxes and concentrations in a neat tabular format.

buildNetworks

This modules provides two methods to build a linear chain of reactions using either mass-action or Michaelis-Menten
kinetics or a random network using uniuni, unibi, biuni or bibi mass-action governed reactions.
